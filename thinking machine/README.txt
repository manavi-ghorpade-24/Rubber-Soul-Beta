No code. No app. No API. No server.

Just structured English that programs AI behavior.

Built on 7M+ impressions. 215 scoring factors. Runs inside any AI.

## Three Modes

### Mode 1 — IDEATION
Don't know what to write about? Start here.
- Guided discovery to find your topic
- Angle generation (one at a time, not overwhelming)
- Hook development
- Evidence gathering
- Full Socratic inquiry available

### Mode 2 — DEVELOPMENT
Have a rough idea? Refine it.
- Deep Socratic questioning
- Excavate your revelation
- Find your costly signal
- Identify your coalition
- Build from insight, not template

### Mode 3 — OPTIMIZATION
Have a draft? Improve it.
- Full 215-factor scoring
- Craft dimensions (16, 165 points)
- Trust architecture (14 patterns, 50 points)
- Specific fixes ranked by impact
- Predicted impression ranges

## What's New in BETA

- **Mode architecture clarified**: Each mode is complete. You stay in it until done.
- **One thing at a time**: No more walls of options. Sequential, menu-driven.
- **Explicit "I don't know" path**: Mode 1 now guides users who have no topic.
- **New commands**: `/deeper`, `/research more`, `/hooks`, `/objections`
- **Clear exit ramp**: Publish prep is explicit with copy/paste instructions.
- **Image guidance**: Specific prompts for GPT, Grok, or search terms for finding images.
- **Consistent navigation**: Letter options and slash commands align.

---

## Training Basis

- 7M+ impressions analyzed
- 300+ posts examined
- Top 100 viral posts deconstructed
- Multi-model validation (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok)
- 6 months of real-world testing

## The Core Thesis

Trust at scale comes from:
- **Revelation** — letting people in on something hidden
- **Costly signals** — risking something real
- **Coalition** — uniting people who share an identity

Content that travels isn't optimized for algorithms.
It's optimized for humans.
